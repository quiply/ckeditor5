## Predefined builds

{@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds Predefined CKEditor&nbsp;5 builds} are a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. Every “build” provides a single type of editor with a set of features and a default configuration. They cover the most common editing use cases, and you can install them easily. See all of them in action: {@link examples/builds/classic-editor classic}, {@link examples/builds/inline-editor inline}, {@link examples/builds/balloon-editor balloon}, {@link examples/builds/balloon-block-editor balloon block}, {@link examples/builds/document-editor document}, and {@link examples/builds/multi-root-editor multi-root} editors! Learn their differences by using our examples and analyzing the source code of the builds.

## Advanced custom builds

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a configurable framework created with collaboration in mind. It lets you build a custom editor of any type, with a wide set of features and the toolbar type that you need where multiple authors can easily work on the same rich text documents. Check out our {@link examples/builds/full-featured-editor feature-rich editor} that sports as many plugins as possible to put together. Want to invite some friends? Try the {@link examples/builds/collaborative-document-editor collaborative document editor} that brings the experience of the most popular online editing solutions to the table. And witness the flexibility of the UI in the {@link examples/custom/bottom-toolbar-editor toolbar-oriented example}.

## Framework examples

{@link framework/index CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework} is a highly flexible and universal platform that provides a set of components allowing you to create any kind of rich text editor. It enables the integrators to build different, custom-tailored editing solutions with {@link examples/custom-ui custom UI} or {@link examples/theme-customization a theme} that suit their specific needs. It also provides tools for the creating and integrating of {@link examples/framework/data-from-external-source some user-made}, {@link examples/framework/content-placeholder custom features} and for customizing {@link examples/chat-with-mentions existing ones}. See how CKEditor 5 can integrate a {@link examples/framework/using-react-in-a-widget React library} to enrich both the contents and the editing experience.

## Experimental solutions
