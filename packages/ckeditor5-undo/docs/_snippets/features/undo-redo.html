	<p>In the days of images and icons, the written word has significantly lost its impact. Your potential readers suffer attention deficiency &mdash; they tend to omit writing longer than a glance. This is a tough situation for anyone as it invalidates the primary purpose of writing anything.</p>

	<p>And the primary purpose of writing is <em>to sell</em>. Whatever you do, it is always about selling. Not only writing, but <em>everything</em> is about selling. Adverts sell. TV commercials sell. Facebook posts sell. Tweets sell. This may be a product, a service, a car, or a software bundle, but also your point of view, your opinion, or your image. Even your cosplay photos on Instagram sell some idea about yourself.</p>

	<p>This is even more obvious in the professional writing environment &mdash; we are here to sell. Whether we want to encourage people to try the new fancy frapuccinate grande turtleneck soda, convince them to exchange their old 2015 combi van model for the newest hybrid 2023 model, or want them to buy a book about the Silesian private eye &mdash; we all aim at selling.</p>
